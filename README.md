Insert and delete In Mysql using Java

This uses mysql, you need to import the provided sql file and edit the credentials in the program.

To run issue the following commands

1. javac -cp ".:mysql-connector.jar" StudentInfo.java

2. java -cp ".:mysql-connector.jar" StudentInfo

I call a new JFrame everytime a delete/insert is performed.
